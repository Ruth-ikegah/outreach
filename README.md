# outreach
Repo for ideas and community discussions about InterMine-related outreach and communities. *Everyone* is welcome to chime in by creating issues or commenting on them.

Where issues get too long or list-like we may need to migrate content out to .md files and encourage users to PR - or email us so we can add details.
